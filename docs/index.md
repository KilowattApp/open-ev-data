## Overview

In contrast to ICE cars, electric vehicles have very different behaviors in terms of charging and charging speed. Having reliable data about a car is key for developing EV-related applications.

## Quick Start

The dataset is available in two formats:

- V1 (Legacy): Single JSON file at `data/ev-data.json`
- V2 (Current): Split into multiple files in `data/v2/` for better maintainability

Both formats can be freely integrated into ANY application under the terms of our [license](https://github.com/KilowattApp/open-ev-data#license). Attribution is required.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to add a new vehicle:

### The full walkthrough

- Look up as much data as you can find about the model or model variant of the vehicle you want to add
- Clone this repository
- Make sure you have Ruby version 3.2 or higher installed
- Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
- Create a git branch for your update: `git checkout -b adding-my-missing-car-model`
- Run the `add_vehicle.rb` script and answer the questions about the model you are adding
- Once you've added the missing data run the tests to validate: `bundle exec rake test`
- Commit and push your changes: `git commit -am "my JSON updates"`
- Finally create a pull request with your updated JSON data

### TLDR

- Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
- Run the `add_vehicle.rb` script and answer the questions about the model you are adding
- Create a pull request with your updated JSON data

## Data Structure

The dataset includes:

- Vehicle identification (Brand, Model, Release Year)
- Battery specifications
- Charging capabilities (AC/DC)
- Charging curves
- Energy consumption data

For detailed information about the data structure and validation rules, see our [Data Formats](data-formats.html) documentation.
