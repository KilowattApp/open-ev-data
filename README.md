Open Dataset of Electric Vehicles and their specs.

In contrast to ICE cars, electric vehicles have very different behavious in
terms of charging and charging speed. Hence having reliable data about a car is
the key for developing EV-related applications.

This dataset (`data/ev-data.json`) can be freely integrated into ANY
application under the terms of our [license](#license). Attribution is required.

This data is used for [Kilowatt â€“ Electric Car Timer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kilowatt-electric-car-timer/id1502312657?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200) app available on the Apple App Store.

This project started as a fork of the side project of the charging price and tariff comparison platform
[Chargeprice](https://www.chargeprice.app) who stopped maintaining this project.

## Available Data

At the moment mostly charging related data is available. Feel free to add more
data if you need it!

* ID: Random UUID
* Brand
* Vehicle Type (car, motorbike)
* Model
* Release Year: Mainly to distinquish models with the same name.
* Variant: Bigger battery, optional faster on-board charger etc.
* Usable Battery Size: in kWh
* Average Energy Consumption: in kWh/100km
* Voltage architecture: 400v or 800v charging
* AC Charger: Details about the on-board charger.
  * Usable Phases: No. of usable phases for AC charging. Allowed values: 1,2,3
  * Ports: Allowed values: `type1`, `type2`
  * Max Power: in kW
* DC Charger: `null` if the car doesn't support DC charging
  * Ports: Allowed values: `ccs`, `chademo`, `tesla_suc`, `tesla_ccs`
  * Max Power: in kW
  * Charging Curve: Simplified charging behaviour based on various charging
    curve charts (e.g. Fastned). If no charging curve data is available, the
    default curve is assumed to be: 0%: 95% of max. DC power, 75%: max. DC
    power, 100%: max. AC power.
    * percentage: Charging level of battery in percentage
    * power: in kW
  * Is Default Charging Curve: `true` if the charging curve is based on the
    default curve instead of real measured data.
